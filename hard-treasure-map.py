Instructions
This is a difficult challenge. 💪

You are going to write a program that will mark a spot on a map with an X.

In the starting code, you will find a variable called map.

This map contains a nested list. When map is printed this is what it looks like, notice the nesting:

[['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️'],['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️'],['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']]

This is a bit hard to work with. So on lines 6 and 23, we've used this line of code print(f"{line1}\n{line2}\n{line3}") to format the 3 lists to be printed as a 3 by 3 grid, each on a new line.

['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']

['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']

['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']
Now it looks a bit more like the coordinates of a real map.

Your job is to write a program that allows you to mark a square on the map using a letter-number system.


First, your program must take the user input and convert it to a usable format.

Next, you need to use that input to update your nested list with an "X". Remember that your nested list map actually looks like this:

[['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️'],['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️'],['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']]
Example Input 1
B3
Example Output 1
Hiding your treasure! X marks the spot.
['⬜️', '️⬜️', '️⬜️']
['⬜️', '⬜️', '️⬜️']
['⬜️️', 'X', '⬜️️']

Hints
See if this List method helps you: https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_list_index.asp

Remember that nested Lists in Python are accessed from outside to inside. e.g. In the List below:

list = [['A', 'B, 'C'], 'E', 'F', 'G']
E is list[1] C is list[0][2]

Check your formatting. This is correctly formatted:
['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']
['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']
['⬜️', 'X', '⬜️']
vs.

Incorrectly formatted (missing a space before 'X and extra space after the X and extra space before the comma):

['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']
['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']
['⬜️','X ' , '⬜️']
